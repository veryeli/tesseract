    "We are healing the world. We care for ourselves so we can help others step out of colonial metronomes and into the rhythms immanent around us. Practices are contextual: greeting or bidding farewell to the sun; honoring new and full moons, equinoxes and solstices; and other rituals. We embrace syncretic paths.",
    "Practices also include land stewardship, communal meals, housing co‑ops, and collective celebrations. Alone we are a line; together we become a tesseract within the tesseract, stronger and holding endless tensions."
