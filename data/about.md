# the Church of the Tesseract

is a community of people seeking a living, breathing relationship with the sacred instrument of time

we free ourselves from colonial rhythms and rediscover sacred connection with creation

gatherings reclaim time as sacred, to resist its capture by systems of extraction and control

this is a religion for those in all diasporas from time-imminent communities. for people who may be areligious but are not aspiritual.


# the Tesseract
the Tesseract is a sacred instrument, extending in all dimensions, through time and space. it is present at the beginning and end of all things, and contains them.

reality is layered, multiple, and richer than our first perspective. In the complex interlacing of the tesseract, all realities already exist.

the lines of power in the tesseract are lines of power in reality. through deeper connection to time and space, we can come to a deeper understanding of the structures that structure our reality.

this increases our power to act.

# our cosmology
God is time, is birth and death and reincorporation, is substance. everything from the beginning to the end is contained within it.

God is a hyperobject, extending in all directions within and beyond perception. we cultivate a living relationship with it and seek return to creation itself.

a future beyond resilience already exists in cosmic fabric — immanent though outside immediate perception.

God is the way home from deep alienation. moving towards God, moving towards the tesseract, is moving into a community developing its own rhythms.

# our practice
is to heal the world through moving with it.

we keep in communication with ourselves and with all creation.

we put our oxygen masks on so we can help others to also step out of colonial metronomes and into the rhythms immanent around us.
these practices are contextual: rituals may include greeting or bidding farewell to the sun; honoring new and full moons, equinoxes and solstices. We embrace syncretic paths.

practices also include land stewardship, communal meals, housing co‑ops, and collective celebrations. alone we are a line; together we become a tesseract within the tesseract, stronger and holding endless tensions.


# sub-practices

**community** our greatest enemy is alienation, and together we find ways to connect and develop understanding together. we want a good life in common. building ritual and new forms of life together and relying on each other in times of need and plenty is one of the most powerful ways to return to ourselves.

**development** to develop new ways to be closer to the tesseract, we need resilience, so we need to develop resources and share them. sharing and creating housing, skills, and meals are ways to heal the world and help others connect to time.

**learning** studying power and time and sharing learning with others is a key strategy to find patterns and ruptures.

**territories** free territories have existed throughout time: Zapatistas, liberated Rojava, the Cop City resistance, Standing Rock — places of immanent tesseract practice. land is the physical manifestation of time. stewarding land and being in right relationship with it is core to our practices.

**morales** shared resistants songs are a core part of connection to time. We encourage community musical gatherings - like the Kurdish morales - to mark times of victory and defeat. the time before the morale necessitates the morale, from sorrow or delight. we let our bodies drive our rituals.

**prisons** in institutions like prisons and psych wards, time is chopped into rigid, cold bits, or stretched out in unmarked, empty expanses. reclaiming felt time is a first step away from the spiritual condition of institutionalization and towards retaining one's own self.

# enemies

our enemies are the structures of power and control, and we create solidarity in the spaces where they don't have a hold. when we practice time of our own, we create a hold. these are practices that are indigenous. people find each other and themselves.

in this life, we mark time, or have it marked for us. for too many of us it is controlled by extraction and coercion. we've been severed from our own time, and thus from the land, each other, and creation itself. we have to take it back, and be bound to our own rhythms.

we're meant to feel disoriented; they've stolen rites and connections.

# what is time
we understand time's sacred relationship to us. we free ourself to be closer to creation itself.

time is not linear, it swirls out, fractal-like in all directions, and is different for each of us. to know God we must know strangers and neighbors. we welcome diverse relationships to time and God, embracing diverging practices."
