# the Church of the Tesseract

the church is a community of people seeking a living, breathing relationship with the sacred instrument of time

we free ourselves from colonial rhythms and rediscover sacred connection with creation

gatherings reclaim time as sacred, to resist its capture by systems of extraction and control

this is a religion for those in all diasporas from time-imminent communities. for people who may be areligious but are not aspiritual.

# the Tesseract
the Tesseract extends in all dimensions. it is present at the beginning and end of all things. it is birth and death; growth and decay; it is all substance and all possible realities. to return to our pre-alienated state, we must cultivate a living, breathing relationship with the Tesseract.

the lines of power within the tesseract are lines of power in reality; so through deeper connection, we can come to a deeper and more strategic understanding of the structures that structure our reality.

this increases our power to act.

a future already exists in cosmic fabric — immanent but outside immediate perception.

# our core practice

our practice is an attitude towards time, not a rigid set of practices. people who greet the sunrise or celebrate the waking of their loved ones or practice profound rest periodically are defining a rhythm. syncretism, the practice of combining traditions in locally specific ways, is the only way to create a living relationship to time.

**ritual** core to the practice is stepping out of colonial metronomes and into the rhythms immanent around us. these practices are contextual: rituals may include greeting or bidding farewell to the sun; honoring new and full moons, equinoxes and solstices. existing rituals may run even deeper than those we coin together; all paths are syncretic.

**community** everyone contains a unique piece of God, and to know one another in our own rhythms is to approach God. sharing communal meals, creating safe shelter, and keeping one another safe and free is just as important as ritual.

**creation**  to be closer to creation is to heal it and ourselves. practices include creating moments and spaces in their own time: land stewardship, music, and moments of pure liberation.

**understanding** we seek to understand, celebrate, and cocreate with others creating a more profound relationship to deep time. through these different rhythms we are approaching a shared horizon.

alone we are each lines; together we become a tesseract within the tesseract, stronger and holding endless tensions. no two practices are the same but all push for another world.


# sub-practices

**community** our greatest enemy is alienation, and together we find ways to connect and develop understanding together. we want a good life in common. building ritual and new forms of life together and relying on each other in times of need and plenty is one of the most powerful ways to return to ourselves.

**development** to develop new ways to be closer to the tesseract, we need resilience, so we need to develop resources and share them. sharing and creating housing, skills, and meals are ways to heal the world and help others connect to time.

**learning** studying power and time and sharing learning with others is a key strategy to find patterns and ruptures.

**territories** free territories have existed throughout time: Zapatistas, liberated Rojava, the Cop City resistance, Standing Rock — places of immanent tesseract practice. land is the physical manifestation of time. stewarding land and being in right relationship with it is core to our practices.

**morales** shared resistants songs are a core part of connection to time. We encourage community musical gatherings - like the Kurdish morales - to mark times of victory and defeat. the time before the morale necessitates the morale, from sorrow or delight. we let our bodies drive our rituals.

**prisons** in institutions like prisons and psych wards, time is chopped into rigid, cold bits, or stretched out in unmarked, empty expanses. reclaiming felt time is a first step away from the spiritual condition of institutionalization and towards retaining one's own self.

# enemies

our enemies are the structures of power and control, and we create solidarity in the spaces where they don't have a hold. when we practice time of our own, we create a hold. these are practices that are indigenous. people find each other and themselves.

in this life, we mark time, or have it marked for us. for too many of us it is controlled by extraction and coercion. we've been severed from our own time, and thus from the land, each other, and creation itself. we have to take it back, and be bound to our own rhythms.

we're meant to feel disoriented; they've stolen rites and connections.

# what is time


time is not linear; it swirls out, in all directions, and is different for each of us.
