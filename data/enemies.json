    "Our enemies are the structures of power and control, and we create solidarity in the spaces where they don't have a hold. When we practice markings of our own, we create a hold. These are practices that are indigenous. People find each other and themselves.",
    "We're meant to feel disoriented in this way; they've stolen from us our inherent rites and connections."
