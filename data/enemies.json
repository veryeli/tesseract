    "our enemies are the structures of power and control, and we create solidarity in the spaces where they don't have a hold. when we practice markings of our own, we create a hold. these are practices that are indigenous. people find each other and themselves.",
    "we're meant to feel disoriented in this way; they've stolen from us our inherent rites and connections."
