    "The Church of the Tesseract believes in finding a way out of the colonial domination of time, and into an authentic relationship with God, or time.",
    "God is time, birth, death, reincorporation — everything before and after. God is substance, which includes time. God is a hyperobject, extending in all directions within and beyond perception.",
    "This instrument has been co‑opted by colonial enemies of freedom and liberation — of organic growth and decay — yet time remains living and breathing. We cultivate a living relationship with it and seek return to creation itself.",
    "This is a religion for those in all diasporas of time‑imminent communities; for people who may be areligious but are not aspiritual."
