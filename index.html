        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          The Church of the Tesseract cultivates a living, breathing relationship with time. We believe time — God — is substance, birth, death, and liberation.
          Our community is dedicated to freeing ourselves from colonial rhythms and rediscovering sacred connection with creation.

        <h2>Symbol</h2>
        <p>
          The tesseract — the four-dimensional analogue of a cube — reminds us that reality is layered, multiple, and richer than our first perspective. It symbolizes humility, imagination, and compassionate expansion. All times exist already.

        <h2>Cosmology</h2>
        <p>
          The Church of the Tesseract believes in finding a way out of time. God is time, birth, death, reincorporation — everything before and after. God is substance, which includes time; God is a hyperobject; time is a sacred instrument.
          This instrument has been co-opted by colonial enemies of freedom and liberation — of organic growth and decay — yet time remains living and breathing. We cultivate a living relationship with it and seek return to creation itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a religion for those in all diasporas of time-imminent communities; for people who may be areligious but are not aspiritual.

        <h2>Practices</h2>
        <p>
          We are healing the world. We care for ourselves so we can help others step out of colonial metronomes and into the rhythms immanent around us. Practices are contextual: greeting or bidding farewell to the sun; honoring new and full moons, equinoxes and solstices; and other rituals. We embrace syncretic paths.
        </p>
        <p>
          Practices also include land stewardship, communal meals, housing co-ops, and collective celebrations. Alone we are a line; together we become a constellation — many worlds moving in tandem toward liberation.

        <p>
          <strong>Morales:</strong> Shared music to mark times of victory and defeat.<br>
          <strong>Prisons:</strong> Resisting domination of time by reclaiming felt time.<br>
          <strong>Development:</strong> Fortitude beyond resilience — sharing housing, skills, meals.<br>
          <strong>Eras:</strong> A future beyond resilience already exists in cosmic fabric.<br>
          <strong>Territories:</strong> Zapatistas, Rojava, Cop City resistance, Standing Rock — places of immanent tesseract practice.

        <h2>Enemies</h2>
        <p>
          Our enemies are structures of power and control. We build solidarity in spaces beyond their hold. By reclaiming indigenous and inherent rites of time, we re-anchor ourselves in creation.

        <h2>What Is Time?</h2>
        <p>
          Time is not linear or singular; it is layered, multiple, and filled with vertices. To know God we must know strangers and neighbors. We welcome diverse relationships to time and God, embracing diverging practices.
