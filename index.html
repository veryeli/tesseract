        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          The Church of the Tesseract cultivates a living, breathing relationship with the sacred instrument of time. We believe time — God — is substance, birth, death, and liberation.
          We free ourselves from colonial rhythms and rediscover sacred connection with creation.

        <h2>The Tesseract</h2>
        <p>
          The tesseract extends in all dimensions, through time and space. It is present at the beginning and end of all things, and contains them.

          Reality is layered, multiple, and richer than our first perspective. In the complex interlacing of the tesseract, all realities already exist.

        <h2>Cosmology</h2>
        <p>
          The Church of the Tesseract believes in finding a way out of the colonial domination of time, and into an authentic relationship with God, or time.
          God is time, birth, death, reincorporation — everything before and after. God is substance, which includes time; God is a hyperobject; time is a sacred instrument.
          This instrument has been co-opted by colonial enemies of freedom and liberation — of organic growth and decay — yet time remains living and breathing. We cultivate a living relationship with it and seek return to creation itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a religion for those in all diasporas of time-imminent communities; for people who may be areligious but are not aspiritual.

        <h2>Practices</h2>
        <p>
          We are healing the world. We care for ourselves so we can help others step out of colonial metronomes and into the rhythms immanent around us. Practices are contextual: greeting or bidding farewell to the sun; honoring new and full moons, equinoxes and solstices; and other rituals. We embrace syncretic paths.
        </p>
        <p>
          Practices also include land stewardship, communal meals, housing co-ops, and collective celebrations. Alone we are a line; together we become a constellation — many worlds moving in tandem toward liberation.

          <strong>Morales:</strong> Shared music to mark times of victory and defeat.<br>
          <strong>Prisons:</strong> Resisting domination of time by reclaiming felt time.<br>
          <strong>Development:</strong> Fortitude beyond resilience — sharing housing, skills, meals.<br>
          <strong>Eras:</strong> A future beyond resilience already exists in cosmic fabric.<br>
          <strong>Territories:</strong> Zapatistas, Rojava, Cop City resistance, Standing Rock — places of immanent tesseract practice.

        <h2>Enemies</h2>
        <p>
          Our enemies are structures of power and control. We build solidarity in spaces beyond their hold. By reclaiming indigenous and inherent rites of time, we re-anchor ourselves in creation.

        <h2>What Is Time?</h2>
        <p>
          Time is not linear or singular; it is layered, multiple, and filled with vertices. To know God we must know strangers and neighbors. We welcome diverse relationships to time and God, embracing diverging practices.
