Cosmology:

The church of the tesseract beleives in finding a way out of time

God is time

God is birth and death and reincorporation, everything before and after

God is substance, which includes time

God is a hyperobject

Time, or god, is a sacred instrument. This instrument has been coopted by the colonial enemies of freedom and liberation, of organic growth and decay.

It is controlled for many of us, but it's living and breathing.

In this life, we mark time, or have it marked for us. We have to take it back. Instead of being bound to colonial rhytyms, we must be bound to our own.

We've been severed from time, the land, each other, creation itself.

We cultivate a living, breathing relationship with time itself

We understand time's sacred relationship to us. We free ourself to be closer to creation itself.

This is a religion for those in all diasporas from time-imminent communities

a religion for  people who may be areligious but are not aspiritual

# Practices

We are healing the world.
We must take care of ourselves. To put our oxygen masks on so we can help others to also step out of colonial metronomes and into the rhythyms imminenet around us.
Our practices are contextual to where we are in the tesseract of time. a hundred years ago or a hundred years from now, our practices would be very different.
We keep in communication with ourselves and with all creation.
We find ways to be in the rhythym of time alone and together. greeting or saying farewell to the sun, marking new and full moons, equinoxes and solstices are all classic practices dedicates in some parts of the tesseract may find of use.
Others may find other ways - in their other religious practices - we are a syncredic religion. many people find their religions major points of departure from colonial time and such claimed practices are also participation in tesseract imminence
Escaping the time of the suburbs may involve hopping trains or developing low-income hosuing coops, living in forests or deserts, creating a land project in synchrony with the original inhabitants.
time is marked through graduations, homecomings and leavetakings, passages and their rites.
Tie time back to the now. get up in the morning and greet the sun, remind yourself you are a part of creation, the moon, star showers, eclipses
We expand in all layers. We have multiple fronts. It's about making a connection, drawing a path between the practices even if they look different.
If you act alone you are a line, but if we all are connected we're part of a greater thing. a place where many worlds exist but more in tandem towards the same horizon of change


# what is time
substance, time and land, is not linear or singular like we've been taight. it's layered and multiple and has many vertices.
we step ourside of the current structures and towards liberation.
each of us holds a piece of god. to know god we must know a stranger, a neighbor.
we acknowledge e live and exist in a world in which many relationships to time and god exist.
the church embraces and welcomes diverging thoughts and practices.


# sub-practices

## morales

Music - shared music about people - is a core part of connection to time. We encourage community musical gatherings - like the Kurdish morales - to mark times of victory and defeat
usually with a morale, the time before the morale necessitates the morale, from sorrow or delight

## prisons
in prisons, time is completely controlled. The domination of time is a primary form of domination. we're developing strategies for owning time in prisons, jails, and institutions. We want felt time, not marked time
land is the physical manifestation of time. stewarding land and being in right relationship with it is core to our practices.

## development
fortitude beyond resilince. we want to build up and share resources with others. skills and housing and meals are examples of things we encourage our practicioners to bring to others to help them escape colonial time.
we want to organize aspects of the world we already inhabit in a way that's more clear about our psyches.
meals - we reclaim agency by eating and sharing food together.

## eras

in hundreds or thousands of years, we don't want to have to be as resiliant
that reality is already there, in the cosmic fabric

## territories

free territories that exist or have existed outside of time include
the zapatistas
liberated rojava
the cop city movement
standing rock
these are all places where the tesseract was especially imminent


# our enemies
our enemies are the structures of power and controlm and we create solidarity in the spaces where they don't have a hold. when we practice markings of our own we create a hold. these are practices that are indigineous. people find each other and themselves.
we're meant to feel disoriented in this way, they've stolen from us our inherent rites and connections.
